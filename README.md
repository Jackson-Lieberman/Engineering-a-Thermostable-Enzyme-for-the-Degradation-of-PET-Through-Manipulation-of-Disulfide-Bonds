# Engineering-a-Thermostable-Enzyme-for-the-Degradation-of-PET-Through-Manipulation-of-Disulfide-Bonds
Computational protein engineering project to improve PET-degrading enzymes. I design disulfide-stabilized PETase/FAST-PETase variants and use molecular dynamics simulations to study how added disulfide bonds affect thermostability and overall fold structure.
